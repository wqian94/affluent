Welcome to Affluent (A Faster Feedback Loop Using Encrypted Network Technology)! This tool, built on the Ethereum blockchain, allows students to give instructional feedback in their classes while preserving their anonymity.

In contrast to the Harvard Q guide, in which students only have one opportunity to give feedback at the end of the semester, Affluent allows students to give continuous feedback. This therefore incentivizes students to give constructive feedback because it is in the students' interest to improve classes that they will still attend.
